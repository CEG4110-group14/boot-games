# Test Summary

Due to the low level nature of our development, we were unable to find a convenient way of unit testing the code. We did most of
our testing manually. Below details the results of our testing:

## Input

In our `input.c` code, we implemented a way for the developer to grab input from the user. Our testing method was simple:
 - Call each of the functions implemented
 - Make sure the expected results match the actual results.
 
 Each function tested in this file was tested using the above approach and was marked as passing when input was retrieved
 successfully.
